https://rovingrunners.herokuapp.com/#/home - FINISHED FOR THE TIME BEING

Made because mom had shown interest in starting a business that travels around putting on
running road races. Will continue working on this project if mother decides she would like to pursue this, otherwise this will be finished so I can work on new projects.

//TODOS 
*Change design to make pages look better, take input from mother as well
*clicking roving runners logo brings page down a few pixels
*When clicking a header tab that is on the home page other than upcoming does not work correctly
*Change instagram scroll to use something such as #roving-runners rather than my personal page
*Setup about us button to link to a page about the company, my mother, and any other important info
*Change how contact form works, maybe setup my own back-end
*Setup social media links to go to actual pages, will create these pages if mother wants to
*Maybe change look of calendar
*Confirm info to use for membership, and setup a way to actually sign up
*Make extras such as pace calculator, FAQs, volunteering, training plans, fun runs
